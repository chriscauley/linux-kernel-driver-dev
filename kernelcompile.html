<p>Compiling the kernel amounts to typing
"<font face="monospace">make"</font>
<p>If you have multiple CPUs or CPU cores
(<font face="monospace">grep
processor /proc/cpuinfo</font>), you can use the "-j" option
of <font face="monospace">make</font>  For example, if you
have 8 CPU cores: 
<pre><font face="monospace">
	make -j8
</font></pre>
This will make things compiler faster.  Some people even
use 4*number-of-cpus as the -j argument. 

<p>If you use the -j argument, you may find that after an error, other
jobs started concurrently by make continue to produce output,
causing any diagnostics to scroll off the screen, and possibly
causing to fail to realize that anything has gone wrong.  After
running <font face="monospace">make -j8</font>, it's a good idea
to check the status by:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	# echo $?
	0
	#
</font</pre>
The status should be zero.  If not, run make again, without
the -j option to see what the errors are (or, of course
you can try to scroll back in your terminal.)

<p>Also, if you find yourself rebuilding the entire kernel
after running <font face="monospace">make clean</font>, but
with the same <font face="monospace">.config</font> file,

can also help a lot to speed things up.
