<p>Configuring the kernel amounts to creating a .config file.
There are several ways to approach this.
<ul>
<li><b>Method 1</b>  Copy the .config file from the kernel
already running on your system, and run "make oldconfig"
and then press <em>Enter</em> a whole bunch.  
<blockquote>This method
has the advantage that it is very likely to work without
problems.  It has the disadvantage that the .config file
of most distros is deliberately very general purpose, and
consequently compiles a ton of stuff you do not need which
makes the compiling process take longer.  On some distros
(e.g. SuSE) you can find the running kernel config file in
/proc/config.gz.  For redhat, you may have to install a 
kernel source RPM, then run "rpmbuild -bp" on the .spec 
file in /usr/src/redhat/..., and recover the generated 
.config file from the /usr/src/redhat/.../BUILD directory.
No idea about how ubuntu does it.</blockquote>

<li><b>Method 2</b>  Customize the kernel config file with
"make menuconfig".  
<blockquote>This option has the advantage that you
can omit modules for hardware which you do not have, thus
saving compile time, but has the disadvantage that it takes
time to manually omit these items, and it is easy to make a
mistake which will cause the system to either not boot or 
be missing some functionality (e.g. network, sound, etc.)
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to customize your kernel, "lspci -k" and
"lsmod" and "modinfo" commands can help you discover what
hardware and modules you currently have running.  For example,
via lspci you may discover that you have an Intel network
adapter.  From this you can infer that you may omit any drivers
for non-intel network adapters from the kernel configuration.
