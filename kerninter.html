<p>Hardware interrupts are registered by a device driver
to tie a particular hardware interrupt to a C function.

To register an interrupt, the device driver calls
the <font face="monospace">request_irq()</font>
function, telling it which interrupt
to hook, and a pointer to a function to call whenever
that interrupt is raised.

We'll go over <a href="interrupts.html">more</a> about interrupts later.
