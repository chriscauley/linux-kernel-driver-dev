<p>How do you know which variant of spin_lock to use?
<p>Assuming a spin lock is appropriate, <b>you can't go
wrong with the irqsave/irqrestore</b> variants.  
<p>But they are slower.  In performance sensitive
code, you may want to consider the other variants.
<p>Which variant you may use depends on two things:
<ol>
<li>In what contexts are the data you are protecting with
the lock accessed?
<p>Possible answers: Data is accessed from 
<ul>
<li>A: only from interrupt context,
<li>B: only from process context,
<li>C: both process and interrupt contexts.
</ul>

<li><p>In what context is this particular bit of code you are writing to
access the data executing?  
<p>Possible answers are: 
<ol>
<li>interrupt context
<li>process context
<li>sometimes interrupt context, sometimes process context.
</ol>
</ol>
