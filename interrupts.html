<li>First, know that I'm going to grossly oversimplify this.

details, have look at Chapter 4 of

<li>Interrupt == IRQ == Interrupt ReQuest.
<li>When something happens on a device that the CPU needs to know about,
the device <em>interrupts</em> the CPU.
For example, maybe an i/o operation the CPU asked the device to perform
has completed, or maybe a network packet has arrived.  Presumably the CPU
wants to know about these kinds of things.
<li>How does the device interrupt the CPU?
<ul>
<li>Old way: The device changes the voltage on a physical wire that is connected
to a programmable interrupt controller (PIC -- or I/O APIC)
chip which in turn changes the voltage on some wires connected to the CPU.
<li>New way (MSI/MSIX): The device does a memory write (DMA) to a pre-arranged 
memory address and some magic chunk of hardware in the path
notices this fact and changes a voltage on a wire connected to the CPU.
</ul>
<li>How does the CPU know which device has interrupted it?
<ul>
<li>It doesn't, not right away.  With each interrupt, there
is a number transmitted to the CPU.
<li>Old way: the PIC conveys this information to
the CPU via a little 8-bit data bus.
<li>New way (MSI/MSIX): The CPU reads the value stored in the
special pre-arranged memory location.
</ul>
<li>The CPU then uses this number to look up in a table which functions
(in various device drivers) to call.
<li>It may be the case that multiple device drivers are called for
a single number, if they are <em>sharing</em> an interrupt, or an IRQ.
(i/o APIC only... MSI/MSIX interrupts are not shared.)
<li>The CPU will call each of these <em>interrupt handlers</em>
in turn.  It is up to the device driver to determine whether the
interrupt is really mean for it (typically by querying some register
on the device to ask the device "did you really interrupt me?")
