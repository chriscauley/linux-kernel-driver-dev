<ul>
<li>vmalloc/vfree
<ul>
<li>vmalloc will return a virtual address of a chunk of memory.
<li>Memory obtained with vmalloc is not necessarily physically contiguous,
the pages may be all over the place.
<li>Memory obtained with vmalloc is not (at least not easily) DMA-able
<li>Use vmalloc when you need memory for a purely software construct
which does not need to be touched by any device.
