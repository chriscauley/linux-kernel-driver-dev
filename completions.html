<p>Sometimes your driver may need to wait for some
event to occur.  A typical scenario might be that the driver
sends some command down to a device and then sleeps until
that operation completes and then continue.  For example,
if it were a disk controller driver it might need to send
down a command to write some data to a disk drive, and
considering the CPU speed, this operation may take awhile.

<p>When the command completes on the disk drive, the interrupt
handler will get called.  The interrupt handler does not have
the same process context as the code which initiated the command.

<p>The process which initiated the command is hanging around sleeping.
So, how does the interrupt handler wake up the sleeping process so that
it knows its requested operation has been completed and that it can
continue?

<p>This is what completions are for.

<p>See include/linux/completion.h

<p>There are a couple of macros to declare completions, 
DECLARE_COMPLETION, and DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK.  The
latter is used when you're storing your completion on the
kernel stack (e.g. in the local variable of a function.)

<p>There is a function, "wait_for_completion()" which will
sleep until the event it is waiting for "completes".

<p>The completion of the event is signalled by calling another
function, "complete()".

<p>An example (from the hpsa driver) should help clarify this

<hr>
<pre>
static inline void hpsa_scsi_do_simple_cmd_core(struct ctlr_info *h,
        struct CommandList *c)
{
	DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(wait);

	c-&gt;waiting = &amp;wait;
	enqueue_cmd_and_start_io(h, c);
	<font color="red">wait_for_completion(&amp;wait);</font>
}
</pre>
<hr>

<p>The above function declares a completion on the stack, then
calls a function called enqueue_cmd_and_start_io -- which
submits some commands down to a device, and then it calls
wait_for_completion().  Wait for completion goes to sleep
until the thing it's waiting for occurs.

<p>When whatever command was submitted completes on the device,
the interrupt handler is called, and eventually the interrupt
handler executes this code:

<hr>
<pre>
static inline void finish_cmd(struct CommandList *c, u32 raw_tag)
{
        removeQ(c);
        if (likely(c-&gt;cmd_type == CMD_SCSI))
                complete_scsi_command(c, 0, raw_tag);
        else if (c-&gt;cmd_type == CMD_IOCTL_PEND)
                <font color="red">complete(c-&gt;waiting);</font>
}
</pre>
<hr>
<p>The call to "complete()" which happens in the interrupt
handler causes the thread of execution which is sleeping inside
the "wait_for_completion()" to wake up and continue.  

<p>There are other variants of wait_for_completion:
<pre>
extern void wait_for_completion(struct completion *);
extern int wait_for_completion_interruptible(struct completion *x);
extern int wait_for_completion_killable(struct completion *x);
extern unsigned long wait_for_completion_timeout(struct completion *x,
                                                   unsigned long timeout);
extern long wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(
        struct completion *x, unsigned long timeout);
extern long wait_for_completion_killable_timeout(
        struct completion *x, unsigned long timeout);
extern bool try_wait_for_completion(struct completion *x);
extern bool completion_done(struct completion *x);

extern void complete(struct completion *);
extern void complete_all(struct completion *);
