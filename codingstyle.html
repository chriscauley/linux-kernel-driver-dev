<ul>
<li>Why is coding style important? 
<ul>
<li><b>Because
if you do not follow the prescribed style,
your patches will not be accepted.</b>
</ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">Documentation/CodingStyle</a>
<li>Run scripts/checkpatch.pl on your patches early and often and
<em>always</em> prior to submitting patches to lkml.
<pre>
<em>do {</em>
	stg push
	<em>do {</em>
		stg show | ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -
		<em>fix whatever checkpatch finds</em>
		stg refresh
	<em>} until checkpatch doesn't find anything</em>
<em>} until all your patches are pushed on. </em>
</pre>
<li>Don't write 1000 lines of code and <em>then</em> try to 
run checkpatch.pl.
<li>Especially do not make a bunch of patches, and then try
to run checkpatch on them all.  Run checkpatch as you go.  If
you don't do this, then when you fix the things checkpatch
finds in the early patches, later patches will break
when you push them on after fixing the earlier patches.
