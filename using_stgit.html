<h3>Stgit -- what is it</h3></a>
<p>Here are some more instructions:
<a href="http://www.procode.org/stgit/doc/tutorial.html">
http://www.procode.org/stgit/doc/tutorial.html</a>.
<p>"Stacked git" or "stg" uses git to manage a stack of patches
on top of your source code.  It allows you to easily maintain
a set of patches, easily change the order in which they are
applied, easily modify your source and control which patches
changes end up in.

<p>Stacked git is the concept of Andrew Morton's patch-scripts,
or quilt, implemented on top of git.  It is better than the patch
scripts in several ways.  Probably the most important difference is that
it does away with the need to inform the system of which files you
intend to modify.  With the patch-scripts, or quilt, forgetting to
"fpatch", or "quilt edit/add" files was one of the easiest and most
common ways to shoot yourself in the foot.  stgit figures out what
files you've changed automatically.
<a name="gettinggit">
<h3>Getting, compiling, and installing git</h3></a>
<p>Most likely, you can get it from your distro
(e.g. apt-get install git on ubuntu, yum install git on Fedora/redhat,
via yast on SLES)

<p>Or, you can get git source here:
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a>
<p>Build it with the usual "./configure ; make ; (as root) make install"
(on  sles, you'll need the zlib-devel package).

<p>You need to tell git who you are.  You only need to do this once
per user per system.  (the data is stored in ~/.git/)

<pre><font face="monospace">
	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email "your.email@whatever.com"
</font></pre>
<a name="getstgit">
<h3>Getting, building, and installing stgit</h3></a>
<p>Get stgit here: <a href="http://www.procode.org/stgit/">http://www.procode.org/stgit/</a>
It's written in python.  You may need some extra packages installed, esp. on sles.
Use yast2 to install python-devel, I think... it will resolve the dependencies, if
you try to figure the dependencies out manually... good luck.
<p>To build, unpack it and type:
<pre><font face="monospace">
make prefix=/usr/local
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
</font></pre>

<a name="kernelstgit">
<h3>Using stgit in a linux kernel tree</h3></a>
<p>After you unpack the kernel, you need to import it into git.
<pre><font face="monospace">
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/scameron/kernels/linux-2.6.29-rc6/.git/
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$ git add .
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$ git commit 
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$ git branch yourbranchname 
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$ git checkout yourbranchname 
</font></pre>
The "git commit" command will open up your $EDITOR and ask for 
a commit message.  Add a commit message like, "initial import of 2.6.29-rc6"

<p>Once that's done, you can set up stgit.
<pre><font face="monospace">
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$ stg init
[scameron@zuul linux-2.6.29-rc6]$
</font></pre>
Now you are ready to work with stgit in the kernel tree to create or import patches, etc.
<a name="cvsstgit">
<h3>Using stgit with CVS or SVN</h3></a>
<p>Using stgit with cvs (or svn) is very similar to using it with the linux
kernel with one important difference.  You need to create a .gitignore file to
keep stgit from trying to incorporate CVS (or .svn) files into the patches.

<pre><font face="monospace">
[scameron@zuul cciss] cat &gt; .gitignore
CVS/
.svn/
*.ko
*.o
^D
[scameron@zuul cciss] git init 
[scameron@zuul cciss] git add . 
[scameron@zuul cciss] git commit 
[scameron@zuul cciss] git branch yourbranchname
[scameron@zuul cciss] git checkout yourbranchname 
[scameron@zuul cciss] stgit init 
</font></pre>
Now you're ready to make or import patches into your CVS tree. 
For an svn managed working directory the concept would 
presumably be similar, except use ".svn/" instead of "CVS/"
in the .gitignore file.
<p>Note, if the CVS (or svn) repository changes, and you want to
pick up those updates (that is, you would like to do a "cvs update"
or "svn update") the way to do it is like this:
<ol>
<li>Use "stg export" to export your patches to protect against disaster.
<li>Pop all your patches off.  If you have an initial patch called "cvsupdate"
leave that one on (or push it back on).
<li>Make a new patch called "cvsupdate"
<li>Do the "cvs update"
<li>do stg refresh.  This takes all the changes from the "cvs update" and
stuffs them into the "cvsupdate" patch.
<li>Push all your patches back on.
</ol>
Subsequent updates, you just do: "stg goto cvsupdate" and "cvs update" and "stg refresh",
then "stg push -a".
<p>You can maintain separate stacks of patches on separate branches
if you wish, and switch between branches using "stg branch branchname"
<p>You can see a list of branches by "stg branch --list"

<td>import_patch</td>
<td>stg import -s directory/series-file</td>
<td>import_patch does not attempt to apply the patches, but 
stg import does.<p>Additionally, with the patch scripts, the easiest
way to create a new patch was to import an empty patch.  With
stg, the easiest way is with "stg new"
<p>Since "stg import" also tries to apply the patch, if it doesn't
apply, it leaves the unapplied patch in a .stgit-failed-patch file,
which you may then resolve however you like (eg: using wiggle).
<p>Beware, do not try something like this:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	for x in $somedir/*.patch
	do
		stg import $x
	done
</font></pre>
As stg will attempt to import each patch in turn, and
continue, even in the face of failures, making a mess.
If you want to do that, do it this way:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	for x in $somedir/*.patch
	do
		stg import $x || exit 1
	done
</font></pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>export_patch</td><td>stg export -d directory</td><td>export_patch prefixes the filenames
in such a way that they sort into the correct order.  "stg export" produces a "series" file
which lists the patches in the correct order.  If the directory does not exist, stg will 
create it.  If it does exist, and contains patches, those patches will be overwritten.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>pstatus</td>
<td>stg series, stg status</td>
<td>pstatus showed the series file, which patches were applied, not applied, or unknown, and 
whether the topmost patch needed to be refreshed ("Needs refpatch").  stg series shows the
list of patches, which are applied ("+"), which are not applied ("-") and which is current
("&gt;").  It does not show if the topmost patch needs refreshing.  "stg status" shows 
which files have been modified since the topmost patch was refreshed, and thus, whether
the topmost patch needs refreshing.  Additionally, if you try doing something without
refreshing (like popping, pushing, etc.) that would mess things up, stgit won't let you.</td>
</tr>
<td>pushpatch</td>
<td>stg push</td>
<td>With pushpatch, you could say, "pushpatch n" where n was a number.  With
stg, it's "stg push -n x" where x is a number.  pushpatch would stop if a patch
failed, and you'd have to do "pushpatch -f" which would make it throw rejects.
"stg push" will push regardless, and put inline conflict markers in the file,
rather than throwing rejects.
<p>Also, with "pushpatch," afterwards you had to do "refpatch."  You don't
have to do "stg refresh" after "stg push" if the "stg push" works.  You
only have to do it if you have to fix something that broke during the
"stg push."
<p>Sometimes "stg push" will say "(modified)" meaning that your patch
went on ok, but it's modified a bit -- some context changed a bit, but
the 3-way merge sorted it out.  You may wish to verify things are ok
when that happens, and if not, change the files to make them ok, and 
"stg refresh."  But, I think the "(modified)" warning is approximately
like "patch" complianing about "offsets."

push or pop patches as necessary to get a named patch to the top of
your stack by <em>stg goto</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>stg squash</td>
<td>
<em>stg squash</em> combines patches.  If you have several patches you want to combine into one
patch, use <em>stg push</em> and <em>stg pop</em> to arrange them next to each other in
the order you like.  Supposing you have patches p1, p2, p3, and you want to combine them 
into a single patch called bigpatch: <em>stg squash p1 p2 p3 -n bigpatch</em>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>stg branch</td>
<td>There are several stg branch commands.  You can have several stacks of patches on the
same codebase, and switch between them with <em>stg branch &lt;branchname&gt;</em>.  You
can see a list of the available branches via <em>stg branch --list</em>.  To create a new
branch, do:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	stg branch master
	git branch newbranchname
	git checkout newbranchname
	stg init
</font></pre>

Note, initially, "stg init" must be run on each branch.
<p>Branches can be a way of checkpointing your work (though not as safe as
<em>stg export</em>).  When you reach a point that you may wish to return to
(when you're about to attempt something risky) you can export your
patches, create a new branch, import your patches on the new branch,
and then attempt the risky maneuver on the branch.  If you hose yourself, you can
just switch back to the original branch, and be back where you started.
(Alternately, just export the patches, and continue, and if it turns
out you need to backtrack, create a new branch then, and import your
exported patches to the new branch, and abandon the botched branch.)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>git add filename<br>
git rm filename</td>
<td>When "stg push" results in conflicts, after you resolve the conflict, you have
to tell stg that you consider the conflich resolved with "git add filename".
No similar concept exists in the patch-scripts.  The use of "git add filename"
for this purpose is horribly counterintuitive.  It used to be that you
did "git resolved filename," which made much more sense, but this was
removed, as apparently all it was doing under the covers was "git add
filename."  The maintainer of stg knows that there are many complaints
about this, and in future revisions of stg, "stg resolved" may re-appear.
One would hope so, at any rate.
<p>One thing to watch out for, if you have some *.orig files, and you
apply patches with patch, and there are offsets, patch will overwrite
those *.orig files, and then the diffs to those *.orig files will get
incorporated into your patch by stg.  Best to not include *.orig files
in git in the first place by adding *.orig into your .gitignore file.

<p>If you have a conflict with a removed file vs. a modified file,
(e.g. say a patch incorporated changes to a *.orig file, so you pop it off,
create a new patch to remove the *.orig files, then push the first
patch back on), the way to resolve the conflict is with "git rm file"

<li><b><a name="stgcvs">Using stg on top of cvs</a></b>
Using stg on top of cvs is useful for "polishing" your changes prior
to committing, so that later, when you want to extract those changes
from cvs, for instance, to try to apply them to a different branch,
you are not facing a giant CVS style merge, but instead, a bunch of 
small, and one hopes, easily portable patches. 
<p>To begin, assume you have a fresh CVS tree checked out.  Make
sure you have a .gitignore file to prevent git from interfering with
CVS's files:

<p>BTW, if you have a remove/modify conflict, that is, say one patch
removes a file, and a later patch tries to modify it, and supposing you
really want the file removed, the way to resolve the patch that tries
to modify the file is to rm the file, then "git rm" the file.

It is a good idea to export your patches every once in a while
(whenever you do some amount of work you would be unhappy to
lose, generally.)  Do not always export the patches to the same directory,
as if you do, each export overwrites the previous set of patches, and
you will limit your ability to recover from mistakes.  I typically use
directory names containing a timestamp, such as "hpsa-patches-2010-01-12-1200pm"
for this purpose.<br>
<pre></pre>
<li><b><a name="cvscommit">Committing patches to CVS</a></b>
<pre></pre>
To commit the patches to cvs, pop all but one off, via, e.g." "stg pop -n 2"
do a "cvs diff -u" to make sure that the difference between the CVS repository
and the working directory is the same as what "stg show" says, then do "cvs commit."
Then, push the next patch on with "stg push", then verify "cvs diff -u" and "stg
show" agree, then "cvs commit" again.  Repeat until all the patches you wish to
commit are committed.  After committing the patches you want to commit, it's
probably a good idea to "stg export" any patches not yet committed, and
then check out a fresh CVS tree, and "stg import" those as yet uncommitted
patches. 
<pre></pre>
<li><b><a name="combine">Combining patches</a></b><br> Sometimes, you may have a patch, and find
there is another change which needs to be made which belongs in the same patch,
and you receive this change from someone else in the form of a patch, or perhaps
you made the change on another branch of the source code, and rather than
re-port the whole of the patch, you just want to spread this incremental
change through the various patchsets on various branches.  To do this, there
is an "stg fold" command, which applies a patch, and incorporates it into the
topmost patch.
<p>Or, you can just position the relevant patch at the top
of the stack, apply it with "patch", and then do stg refresh.
<p>Or, you can use "stg squash.  Use push and pop to get the
patches next to each other in the order you like.  Let's say you
have patches "p1", "p2", "p3", and "p4" which you wish to combine into
a patch named "megapatch."  You'd do:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	stg squash p1 p2 p3 p4 -n megapatch
</font></pre>
The "-n" is for "name", and is the name you want to give to the
combined patch.

<pre></pre>
<li><b><a name="split">Splitting patches</a></b><br>Splitting patches is a bit tougher, but
here's how I do it.  Say you have a patch, "patch-x", which you want to
split into two patches, patch-x1, and patch-x2.  The first thing to
do is "stg export" the patch into a file, and manipulate the patch
stack so that "patch-x" is at the top of the stack, then "stg pop"
the patch, so that it is not currently applied, but is the next patch
to be applied.  Then, use "stg new patch-x1" to create a new patch
just before "patch-x".  Next, make the changes which will go into
patch-x1, one at a time.  
Typically, you'll do this by using filterdiff on the
exported patch-x to select hunks which belong in patch-x1.  After
each hunk for patch-x1 is applied, (via, patch, wiggle, manually,
or by whatever combination of these works best) do an "stg refresh", then an
"stg push" to push patch-x back on, (resolving any conflicts as necessary),
and then an "stg pop."  This "push" and "pop" will end up modifying
patch-x, removing the bits which are in patch-x1.  In this
way, you'll gradually build patch-x1 into what you want, and the
pieces that go into patch-x1 will get gradually get removed from
"patch-x" by the action of "stg push; stg pop".  When patch-x1 is
complete, than patch-x will contain only what remains -- which will
be patch-x2.  You can rename it by "stg rename patch-x patch-x2."
And you will have split patch-x into patch-x1 and patch-x2.
<pre></pre>
<li>
</ul>
<a name="pitfalls">
<h3>Some pitfalls</h3></a>
To guard against pitfalls, you should run "stg export -d some_safe_timestamped_place" frequently
so as not to lose your work.  For instance, I frequently do something like:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	stg export -d ~/hpsa-patches-2010-01-12-1108am
</font></pre>
specifying a different directory each time, or at least changing the
directory name "frequently enough."   If you use the same directory,
it will overwrite what was there, which if your intent is to make a backup,
may defeat the purpose. 

<p>Then, if disaster strikes, and you find your patches hopelessly hosed,
you can get back to a prior sane state simply by unpacking the fresh sources
you started with, and then doing something like this:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	stg import -s ~/hpsa-patches-2010-01-12-1108am/series
</font></pre>

<p><b>Pitfall 1</b>:  Making a change with the wrong patch at the top of the
stack, and incorporating the change into the wrong patch with "stg
refresh."  This will happen from time to time.  After awhile, you'll
learn to be vigilant in avoiding this.  To fix this, see the section
on "splitting" patches, or else revert back to a previously exported
patchset that does not contain the mistake. 

<p><b>Pitfall 2</b>When using wiggle to fix rejects, since wiggle outputs
to stdout, and is not to be trusted without verifying, you generally dump
the output into a different file, and then, when wiggle's done it's best,
you inspect the output, possibly fixing conflicts, etc.  It is easy to forget
when finished to copy this wiggle output file back to the original file which
you were trying to patch.

<p>There are probably other pitfalls, but those are the ones that spring to
my mind.  The main pitfall of quilt, and Andrew Morton's patch-scripts,
which was forgetting to inform the patch system of your intent to modify a
file (fpatch) is absent from stgit, as it automatically detects which files
you change.  If you <em>add</em> a new file, I think you still have to tell
it, via "git add filename".

<a name="additionaltools"><h3>Some additional tools you may find helpful.</h3></a>
<ul>
<li><a name="wiggle"><a href="http://neil.brown.name/wiggle/">wiggle</a></a> can be useful for getting rejected hunks
to go in anyway.  Be careful, sometimes wiggle does completely the wrong thing without
warning.  To compile it, you'll probably have to modify the "dotest" script and remove
the "--quiet" option from some command (unless you're on debian).  You use it like this:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	wiggle filetopatch patch > someotherfile.
</font></pre>
You can remember the order of the argument because they are similar to patch:
<pre><font face="monospace">
	patch filetopatch < patch
</font></pre>
Don't forget after reviewing someotherfile that you need to copy it over filetopatch.
(a mistake that is very easy to make.)
<li><a name="patchutils"><a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/data/patchutils/">patchutils</a></a> contains some
useful things like "filterdiff", which can bust apart a patch into individual hunks,
which is useful when a patch has a some rejects.  It is often the case that you can
bust it apart into hunks, and wiggle the hunks in one by one with reduced pain.  Also
diffstat is in there, iirc.
<li><a href="http://www.cobite.com/cvsps/">cvsps</a>  This is useful for pulling sensible patches
out of cvs, and examining the history in cvs (much better than cvs log, generally).<br>
"cvsps -x -u &gt; log" gets the log, "cvsps -g -s patchsetnumber &gt; patchfile"
to extract patches.
</ul>

<a name="competition">
<h3>Stgit's competition</h3></a>
<p>Lookup "guilt" (not quilt, guilt).  I don't know if it's better
or worse than stgit.
