<p>Three main ways to get the kernel source:
<ul>
<li>Get it from your distribution (kernel source package of some kind).
<li>Tar ball: Get it from <a href="http://kernel.org">Kernel.org</a>
<pre>
copy config file from somewhare, or make own
make oldconfig (or make menuconfig)
make
make install
(on many distros, that's it.)
On ubuntu;
update-initramfs -c -k 2.6.38
update-grub

</pre>
<li>Git repository: Get it with <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> from <a href="http://git.kernel.org">git.kernel.org</a>
<ul
<li>Linus's tree:
<pre>
export http_proxy=<em>whatever your http proxy is</em>  (you may not need this step)
git clone http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
</pre>
<li>You may need some one else's branch of Linus's tree, say Jens Axboe's
block tree:
<pre>
cd linux*
git remote add jens http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-2.6-block.git
git remote update
git branch -a
</pre>
This will show you a list of branches in Jens's tree.  He typically
has some branch called "jens/for-2.6.xx-next" (or jens/for-3.xx-next
these days) which is what will eventually get pulled into Linus's
tree for the next kernel.  You can make a get that like...
<pre>
git checkout -b my-whatever-branch jens/for-2.6.34-next
</pre>
<li>Or maybe you need (SCSI maintainter) James Bottomley's tree:
<pre>
git remote add james http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git
</pre>
And he has several branches.
<p>Or more likely you need somebody else's tree, depending on what
you're working on.   See the MAINTAINERS file in the top directory
of the linux kernel source.

<p>Usually though, either Linus's tree or the latest tarball on
kernel.org will be sufficiently new for you to work with.
