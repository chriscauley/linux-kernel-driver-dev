<ul>
<li>Memory allocated with <b>dma_alloc_coherent</b>
(or <b>pci_alloc_consistent</b>) is not cached, and is
DMA-able at any time, in either direction.  (you may have to flush
the processor's write buffers however (see Documentation/DMA-API.txt)
<li>Memory allocated with kmalloc() must be <em>mapped</em> for DMA
prior to the DMA operation, and <em>unmapped</em> afterwards.
<li><b>dma_map_single(), dma_unmap_single()</b>.<br>
"Mapping" a kmalloc'ed region of memory for DMA with dma_map_single
(or pci_map_single) does a few things:
<ul>
<li>Provides you with a bus address to give the device.
<li>Synchronizes the cache (for writes, flushes the cache, for
reads, might discard the cache lines at this point.)
<li>On some archictecturs (e.g. PowerPC) it may program PCI bridges
up to do bus address/physical address translations.
</ul>
"Unmapping" a kmalloc'ed region of memory for DMA with dma_unmap_single
(or pci_unmap_single) does a few things.
<ul>
<li>Synchronizes the cache (for writes, nothing here, for reads,
it may discard cache entries at this point, if it wasn't done at 
map time.)
<li>(on some architectures) discard any pci bridge
address translations the mapping had set up.
</ul>
<li><b>dma_map_page(), dma_unmap_page()</b>. -- same as *_map_single, but
a page at a time.
<li><b>dma_sync_single_for_device(), dma_sync_single_for_cpu()</b>
If you leave regions mapped for DMA, you can use them multiple
times, and depending on your transfer direction use these to sync
the cache with memory as necessary.
