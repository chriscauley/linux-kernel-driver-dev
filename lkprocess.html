<ul>
<li>Developers (that's you) make "patches" -- sets of
changes -- to the source code
<li>These patches are sent via email to the 
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel">Linux Kernel Mailing List</a>
(linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org) or one of the subsystem mailing lists (e.g.: perhaps the
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi">linux-scsi mailing list</a>
linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org).
<font size=-1>Note: don't try to use Outlook, Yahoo mail, Gmail, Hotmail, as they
will destroy your patches, and don't send patches as attachments,
they should be inline.  Use a mailer like pine or mutt which will
preserve your patch intact.</font>
<li>The patch is reviewed, you fix whatever they complain about, (or argue
why your way is better.)
<Li>The maintainer of whatever subsystem, and/or Andrew Morton incorporates
your patch into their tree.  (Andrew Morton's "MM" tree is here:
<a href="http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/">http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/</a>, in patch form.)
<li>Eventually your patch(es) move into Linus's tree.
</ul>
There is kind of a schedule though:
<ul>
<li>After each release of the kernel (watch http://kernel.org), there is a
"two week merge window" during which patches for the next kernel are
submitted.
<li>After the two week merge window closes, it's only minor bug fixes until
the next kernel comes out and the next merge window starts.
<li>It's generally best to have your patches already in some maintainer's
sub tree prior to the merge window.
<li>You don't have a lot of control over when or if your patches will 
make it into anyone's tree -- is this a bit frustrating?  Yes, yes it is.
That's just how it is.
</ul>
